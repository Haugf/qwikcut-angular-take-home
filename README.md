## To Do
add a video player package to the project, possibly this one https://www.npmjs.com/package/mat-video


## How to run
1. make sure you have angular/cli@1.7.4 installed
>npm install -g @angular/cli@1.7.4
>npm install

2. Run server and automatically open a browser
>ng serve -o 


## Test Plan

If I had more time to test I would 
1. Send in an empty array into the app component
2. Learn how to develop a status checker before running the app.component.html code
    This would inform the user what error occured

## Further Development
If I were to develop this appp further
1. Add a 5 second timer between video clips
2. Add a plot graph comparing current video stats to average of all stats
3. The abilty for the user to add comments to clips
    a. I would have attempted to create a seperate component for this
4. I'd like to make the cards for each clip rasied 
5. Execute my test plan and begin learning Karma
